## APPROACH TAKEN

We first met as a group and decided to make an app that would simulate the inventory of a record store. In discussing our work styles and how to best approach completing this project remotely, we agreed to work in separate shifts and communicate via Slack when we had pushed up our changes and were done working within the project. This allowed us to dedicate a few focused hours at a time to build out the backend, front end and work on styling without worrying about overwriting each other and having merge conflicts.

Slack was our main source of communication and we used it daily to communicate our plans for the day, shift preferences, synopsis of changes made and what we still needed to complete. It was the best way for us to keep in communication as we all have Slack both on our computers as well as our phones.

## UNSOLVED PROBLEMS

We spent the majority of our time working through some weird errors with the Cancel and Full See List buttons generating curious results. 

We were finally able to work out all of the bugs and have a fully functional website to present. Next steps that have been researched but are not fully functional include a search function, member login, and a "cart" function that would impact the inventory.
